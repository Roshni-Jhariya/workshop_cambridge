    "# Workshop Cambridge, September 2018\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is on its way to become the most used programming language in neuroscience. It is easy to understand, can be learned rather quickly and has a very strong and helpful community behind it. There exist many amazing neuroimaging software packages, such as Nipype & fmriprep, that facilitate the everyday life of a neuroscientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this 2-day workshop is to introduce participants to the basics of Python, to give them a short overview about relevant neuroimaging software packages and most of all, to teach them everything they need to know about Nipype. Nipype is an open-source software package, that provides a unified way of interfacing with most of the freely available neuroimaging software packages, such as SPM, FSL, AFNI, FreeSurfer and ANTs.\n",
